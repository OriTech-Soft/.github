# 🔒 Security Policy

We appreciate security research that helps keep our users safe. If you believe you’ve found a vulnerability, please follow this policy.

## 📬 Report a vulnerability
- Email: **security@oriteche.com**
- Include: affected repo/version, technical details, reproduction steps, impact, and (if possible) a minimal PoC.
- Do **not** create a public issue for vulnerabilities.

## ⏱️ Response targets
- **Acknowledgement:** within 72 hours
- **Initial assessment:** within 7 days
- **Fix ETA:** shared once triaged (severity & scope dependent)
- We will keep you informed of progress and request retest when a fix is ready.

## 🔐 Scope & out of scope
**In scope:** vulnerabilities in our open-source repos under the Oritech organization.  
**Out of scope:** third-party dependencies (report upstream), social engineering, physical attacks, spam/DMARC configuration, rate-limit or DoS without meaningful security impact.

## 🛟 Safe harbor
We will not initiate legal action for good-faith, non-disruptive security research that:
- Respects privacy and does not exfiltrate data
- Avoids service degradation or data loss
- Uses only test accounts and minimal data
- Gives us a reasonable time to remediate before disclosure

## 🔏 Disclosure
- Coordinate with us on a mutually agreed disclosure date.
- Credit is given (optional) in release notes/advisories.

## 🔑 Sensitive data
Please **never** include secrets, tokens, or personal data in reports. If you accidentally access such data, stop and notify us immediately.
